            <p>To travel between the stars is her greatest pleasure. If not recorded, her memories would disappear in an instant. She daydreams about what could have been. She weaves magic with spilled ink. The galaxies she sees out of her spaceship window are her writings on canvas, but they never stay for long. There’s nothing left except a filled page.</p>
            <p>It’s this inevitable fate that keeps her treasuring every moment. She knows how terrifying it is to capture nothing. It’s what makes love so bittersweet and life worth living for those few fleeting moments before they disappear forever. She’ll keep writing poems about the seven galaxies until she’s faded from existence. Until there are no more stories to tell.</p>
            <p>Her spaceship rests on the precipice of a mountain covered with the ruins of ancient temples, the old stone catching the light of the setting suns. She’ll write poems about this place for weeks to come before the next starry sky greets her with its mysteries in tow. The stars are close tonight.</p>
            <p>It’s easier than ever to believe they’re friendly creatures watching over the life-forms of this world as they sleep beneath their blanket of twinkling lights. She wonders if they’re awake, and they see her. The celestial bodies tell her their secrets in a language only she can understand; they tell her stories of space and time, love and loss.</p>
            <p>She has insatiable hunger, the urge to travel and document more places. Humans have seen little of the beauty in the universe. What would happen if we never explored? She remembers the questions she asked as a child. “What if there’s something we can’t see? Somewhere waiting to be discovered?”</p>
            <p>Though she writes poetry and survives on creativity, she’s on a quest for knowledge, one of discovery and exploration. Her existence wasn’t always this blissful. She’d never been so lost. As if something had been ripped out of her. Was it always that way? The sinister feeling in the pit of your stomach when you knew there would be nothing or anyone to fill its void?</p>
            <p>Underneath her simple desire lies a much deeper meaning. She needed to document. She traveled further than anyone before her, searching to find something different. Humans explore but see nothing new.</p>
            <p>She stood on a cliff as the sun rose over an alien world. She felt like she’d found a home despite being insignificant compared to everything else around her. When night fell, she wrote about what she saw. The cosmos aligned, and she found herself amongst the stars at last.</p>

            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
