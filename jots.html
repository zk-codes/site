                        <p>Found this in the depths of my notes. Written several years ago.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>dogs teeth encircling his joints</p>
                            <p>more piercings than facial skin</p>
                            <p>he shares his name with your favorite weather pattern</p>
                            <p>like a meteorologist in love you think of him every time the word hits your ears</p>
                            <p>is this how it is?</p>
                            <p>going around in circles</p>
                            <p>the kind of orbit that pulls tides</p>
                            <p>and leaves salt in the cracks of your palms</p>
                            <p>you trace the patterns he leaves behind</p>
                            <p>like constellations you’ll never name but always recognize</p>
                            <p>his laughter is a storm breaking over the horizon</p>
                            <p>the kind that washes everything clean</p>
                            <p>he wears his history like a second skin</p>
                            <p>scars and ink and metal all tangled together</p>
                            <p>the sky outside is heavy with clouds</p>
                            <p>you wonder if he’s thinking of you too</p>
                            <p>or if you’re just another echo</p>
                            <p>another ripple in a pond you didn’t mean to disturb</p>
                            <p>is this how it is?</p>
                            <p>spinning in place while the world moves on</p>
                            <p>holding onto something that’s already gone</p>

                        <blockquote>

                            <p><em>Your tale is one everyone thinks they know</em></p>

                            <p><em>Yet they mourn the loss as if you've died, as if there's only one way</em></p>
                            <p><em>For this to end, and for that to be in flames</em></p>
                            <p><em>Woe betide those who are naive, the doomsdayer proclaims</em></p>
                            <p><em>So be it, I shall claim the side of those led astray</em></p>
                            <p><em>Because the internet is not dying. Not now, not ever, and not today</em></p>

                    <div class="e-content p-name">
                        <p>Attended my first virtual author talk for while: Lisa Jewell's. Haven't read her books but it's always wonderful to hear from a writer.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fascinating stories often come from unanswerable questions you ask the most.</li>
                            <li>Novels often come from a singular, recurring image that won't let you go.</li>
                            <li>Write with love. People will notice.</li>
                            <li>Revisions follow the same paradox as time travel: woe if you meet your previous self.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes the most fun characters to write are the most awful.</li>
                            <li>The smallest things derail or make an entire story: use that to your advantage.</li>
                            <li>There's nothing wrong with writing stories that continually focus on the same themes.</li>
                            <li>A readership is a remarkable, delicate thing. Treat it with care.</li>
                            <li>Social media isn't for sales, it's for strengthening relationships with your readers.</li>
                            <li>Life lived through writing books.</li>
                            <li>You pour yourself onto the page only to leave so much unsaid...the beauty of subtext.</li>

                    <p><strong><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-30">30 May 2025</time></strong></p>
                    <div class="e-content p-name">
                        <p>Found some old notes from an online poetry workshop last year from the <a href="https://emergingwritersfestival.org.au/" rel="noopener">Emerging Writers Festival</a> on 6 Sep 2024: Erasure & The Burning Haibun, hosted by Muntia Tafassum Ahmed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Erasure attempts to conceal and reveal: a beautiful juxtaposition.</li>
                            <li>Erasure is a collaboration/conversation between two texts: one old, one new.</li>
                            <li>Erasure doesn't have to be just crossed out newsprint lines, it can be an art form. Fade out the original text so you can still read it, or keep the erased text next to the original.</li>
                            <li>Make drawings to mask the erasures for a mixed media effect.</li>
                            <li>Create erasure with your writing: cross out words/phrases for two stories in one work.</li>
                            <li>What impact do you want it to have on the source text?</li>
                            <li>The haibun gained popularity in late 17th century Japan: a prose poem starting with autobiographical or non-fiction prose and closing with a metaphorical haiku.</li>
                            <li>The burning haibun is an erasure twist on the original created by Torrin A. Greathouse: it finds the closing haiku in the original opening prose.</li>
                            <li>The original haibun focuses on the external world, the burning on the internal.</li>
                            <li>Lowercase source text unifies the erasure.</li>
                            <li>A fascinating concept to play with for a burning haibun is a memory you have a different opinion of than when it originally happened.</li>

                        <p>Here's a poem I found when clearing out notes. It's about Xander, from <a href="/books">Don't Burn Too Bright.</a></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>he wears his scars like he has something to prove</p>
                            <p>has to declare his battleworthiness to the world</p>
                            <p>so they don't threaten to shatter him again</p>
                            <p>he's been torn apart by his nobilty</p>
                            <p>stitched back together with the ashes of his demise</p>
                            <p>he's watched the stars fall from their perches, the sun set itself alight and swallow the world he once treasured</p>
                            <p>created to be a destroyer of worlds</p>
                            <p>lost loves tattooed across his shoulders</p>
                            <p>bandages against the universe's battering ram</p>
                            <p>eyes like the burning volcano where he met his almost end</p>
                            <p>and still</p>
                            <p>he smiles</p>

                        <p>Below is a poem I wrote based on the prompt 'here again.' It's called 'The Persistance Of What Never Was' and it's the first time I've written poetry in years, let alone published it.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Energy like blazing sunsets inscribes itself across the tender membrane of memory. Your smile was a constellation of promises he nor you understood how to keep.</p>
                            <p>Time, that patient architect of longing, was all he needed to fall headlong.</p>
                            <p>How easily he mistook vertigo for love.</p>
                            <p>Banished from your mother’s arms when you stretched toward adulthood, claiming territory she couldn’t surrender...her rejection etched acid patterns in your eyes.</p>
                            <p>He hated her for that. Still does. Endlessly resurrecting his pain.</p>
                            <p>The light dimmed in your gaze as days collapsed into weeks, months, years.</p>
                            <p>As if someone adjusted a dial within you.</p>
                            <p>Turning down the brightness until shadows pooled in places once illuminated.</p>
                            <p>Preteens with teeth became your salvation myth.</p>
                            <p>Those awkward warriors with metal smiles who offered belonging when home became a geography of absence.</p>
                            <p>You swore this to him between whispers and midnight confessions, while they saved and devoured you.</p>
                            <p>You. The fool who trusted.</p>
                            <p>What would you think, now, knowing he became one of them?</p>
                            <p>The symmetry would wound you.</p>
                            <p>If that was how the narrative arc completed, this story would end here.</p>
                            <p>But grief is never so merciful.</p>
                            <p>He wishes you survived. But wishes alone can’t reconstruct molecules scattered beyond retrieval.</p>
                            <p>Here he stands, succumbing to memory’s persistent hauntings.</p>
                            <p>Your ghost refuses to leave.</p>
                            <p>It returns in the scent of rain on concrete, in the shade of afternoon light that renders the ordinary mysterious, in the laughter of strangers who sound nothing like you.</p>
                            <p>You haunt him with relentless grace, the persistent echo that refuses silence, mapping his days with your absence.</p>
                            <p>Here again, then gone, then here again: the rhythm of loss becoming his pulse.</p>
                            <p>No matter where he travels, or when he believes the wound has closed, your presence arrives. Uninvited yet essential: blood rushing back to numbed limbs, the painful reminder of continued existence.</p>
                            <p>When his own ending approaches, your face, frozen in youth’s impossible promise, a photograph never taken but developed in the darkroom of remembrance...</p>
                            <p>Will be what blurs his vision. Not his life unspooling in retrospect.</p>
                            <p>But you.</p>
                            <p>Eternal in your incompleteness.</p>
                            <p>The story that keeps beginning long after its conclusion.</p>

                            <li>In HTML, there are things called 'void' elements, like <code>img</code> because it doesn't have a closing tag.

                        <p>While much gets written about affirmations and their positive benefits... It's never made it passed my intense skepticism. Why should I repeat to myself things which might not be true?</p>
                        <p>I always thought they had more impact if they came from others, but depending on the outside world to receive them... It's out of your hands. Writing and reciting your own is a way of taking back control. Besides, isn't it akin to a gratitude list or journal? </p>

                            <li>Don't sell yourself short. People will like your zines!</li>
                            <li>Bring zines to trade as an excuse for interesting conversations.</li>

                            <li>Make zines on paper and clean them up and arrange them digitally.</li>
                            <li>Print folded zines double-sided so there's an interesting surprise on the non-content side.</li>
                            <li>You can sew bindings for zines with a sewing machine.</li>

                    <p><strong><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-26">26 Jan 2025</time></strong></p>
                    <div class="e-content p-name">
                        <p>In late December 2024, I attended an Are.na <a href="https://www.are.na/editorial/gifting-guides" rel="noopener">Channel As Gift</a> workshop hosted by <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/" rel="noopener">Laurel Schwulst</a>. Such a fascinating idea! These are my notes from attending.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gifting as a verb is more nourishing than the noun.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.are.na/laurel-schwulst/channel-as-gift" rel="noopener">Gift giving</a> is often separated as its own love language, but you could argue all other love languages involve giving a gift.</li>
                            <li>Attention and time are the ingredients for a good gift. Being a good gift giver is about listening, appreciating, and considering. You make connections between disparate things and the people you love.</li>
                            <li>Living with the intention of generosity is gift giving at its core. Even something an email can be a gift: putting in effort shows you care.</li>
                            <li>A wonderful gift is a Venn diagram of what you and the recipient enjoy. A moment of connection often becomes more important than the material thing.</li>
                            <li>Thoughtful digital gifts: a memory capsule of photos, a playlist, a reader of recommended articles or books, summarizing your shared existence, an imaginary museum, reasons they're loved, and a to-do list of fun activities</li>
                            <li>Gifting as an infinite game is a constant back-and-forth, a way of life.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="e-content p-name">
                        <p>I attended <a href="https://www.are.na/are-na-editorial/channel-walkthrough-with-daniel-lefcourt-and-travess-smalley" rel="noopener">a virtual Are.na walkthrough</a>: <a href="https://www.travesssmalley.com/" rel="noopener">Travess Smalley</a> & <a href="https://certainlynot.com/" rel="noopener">Daniel Lefcourt</a>. They discussed how they use it to develop their ideas.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unrelated fields overlap in unexpected ways: new insights in disparate connections.</li>
                            <li>Save everything you find interesting. You never know how it might inspire you.</li>
                            <li>If there ins't a word to describe what you're exploring, there's opportunity there.</li>
                            <li>Art is a language. And just as we study books to find how we write, we can study artworks to discover how we express ourselves.</li>
                            <li>Each painting sings the same song, uniquely.</li>
                            <li>When you discover something new, you want to find others like them. If the creators share their influences, you'll discover something unique. So share yours.</li>
                            <li>The beauty of mixed media is you can mix and match often separate senses for surprising results. For example, sheet music as artworks.</li>
                            <li>Learn the rules of software to break them to make art with unusual constraints.</li>
                            <li>Rules are freeing when overwhelmed by the limitless of creativity, but breaking them and creating beyond them is often where the most fascinating ideas come from.</li>
                            <li>If you're stuck on a problem, working it out on paper can lead to breakthroughs.</li>
                            <li>Our taste influences what we make. Begin with what you love and build upon it.</li>
                            <li>The computer is a creative assistant, a portal to inspiration, or an art medium. Experiment.</li>
                            <li>Creative processes as programming scripts.</li>
                            <li>Book or zine making is such a rewarding process as it allows for constant experimentation.</li>
                            <li>Paper is an excellent tool for processing information and engaging with a work.</li>
