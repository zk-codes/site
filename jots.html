                <p>Found some old notes from an online poetry workshop last year from the <a href="https://emergingwritersfestival.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerging Writers Festival</a> on 6 Sep 2024: Erasure & The Burning Haibun, hosted by Muntia Tafassum Ahmed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Erasure attempts to conceal and reveal: a beautiful juxtaposition.</li>
                    <li>Erasure is a collaboration/conversation between two texts: one old, one new.</li>
                    <li>Erasure doesn't have to be just crossed out newsprint lines, it can be an art form. Fade out the original text so you can still read it, or keep the erased text next to the original.</li>
                    <li>Make drawings to mask the erasures for a mixed media effect.</li>
                    <li>Create erasure with your writing: cross out words/phrases for two stories in one work.</li>
                    <li>What impact do you want it to have on the source text?</li>
                    <li>The haibun gained popularity in late 17th century Japan: a prose poem starting with autobiographical or non-fiction prose and closing with a metaphorical haiku.</li>
                    <li>The burning haibun is an erasure twist on the original created by Torrin A. Greathouse: it finds the closing haiku in the original opening prose.</li>
                    <li>The original haibun focuses on the external world, the burning on the internal.</li>
                    <li>Lowercase source text unifies the erasure.</li>
                    <li>A fascinating concept to play with for a burning haibun is a memory you have a different opinion of than when it originally happened.</li>

                <p>Here's a poem I found when clearing out my notes. It's about Xander, from <a href="/books">Don't Burn Too Bright.</a></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>he wears his scars like he has something to prove</p>
                    <p>has to declare his battleworthiness to the world</p>
                    <p>so they don't threaten to shatter him again</p>
                    <p>he's been torn apart by his nobilty</p>
                    <p>stitched back together with the ashes of his demise</p>
                    <p>he's watched the stars fall from their perches, the sun set itself alight and swallow the world he once treasured</p>
                    <p>created to be a destroyer of worlds</p>
                    <p>lost loves tattooed across his shoulders</p>
                    <p>bandages against the universe's battering ram</p>
                    <p>eyes like the burning volcano where he met his almost end</p>
                    <p>and still</p>
                    <p>he smiles</p>

                <p>Below is a poem I wrote based on the prompt 'here again.' It's called 'The Persistance Of What Never Was' and it's the first time I've written poetry in years, let alone published it.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Energy like blazing sunsets inscribes itself across the tender membrane of memory. Your smile was a constellation of promises he nor you understood how to keep.</p>
                    <p>Time, that patient architect of longing, was all he needed to fall headlong.</p>
                    <p>How easily he mistook vertigo for love.</p>
                    <p>Banished from your mother’s arms when you stretched toward adulthood, claiming territory she couldn’t surrender...her rejection etched acid patterns in your eyes.</p>
                    <p>He hated her for that. Still does. Endlessly resurrecting his pain.</p>
                    <p>The light dimmed in your gaze as days collapsed into weeks, months, years.</p>
                    <p>As if someone adjusted a dial within you.</p>
                    <p>Turning down the brightness until shadows pooled in places once illuminated.</p>
                    <p>Preteens with teeth became your salvation myth.</p>
                    <p>Those awkward warriors with metal smiles who offered belonging when home became a geography of absence.</p>
                    <p>You swore this to him between whispers and midnight confessions, while they saved and devoured you.</p>
                    <p>You. The fool who trusted.</p>
                    <p>What would you think, now, knowing he became one of them?</p>
                    <p>The symmetry would wound you.</p>
                    <p>If that was how the narrative arc completed, this story would end here.</p>
                    <p>But grief is never so merciful.</p>
                    <p>He wishes you survived. But wishes alone can’t reconstruct molecules scattered beyond retrieval.</p>
                    <p>Here he stands, succumbing to memory’s persistent hauntings.</p>
                    <p>Your ghost refuses to leave.</p>
                    <p>It returns in the scent of rain on concrete, in the shade of afternoon light that renders the ordinary mysterious, in the laughter of strangers who sound nothing like you.</p>
                    <p>You haunt him with relentless grace, the persistent echo that refuses silence, mapping his days with your absence.</p>
                    <p>Here again, then gone, then here again: the rhythm of loss becoming his pulse.</p>
                    <p>No matter where he travels, or when he believes the wound has closed, your presence arrives. Uninvited yet essential: blood rushing back to numbed limbs, the painful reminder of continued existence.</p>
                    <p>When his own ending approaches, your face, frozen in youth’s impossible promise, a photograph never taken but developed in the darkroom of remembrance...</p>
                    <p>Will be what blurs his vision. Not his life unspooling in retrospect.</p>
                    <p>But you.</p>
                    <p>Eternal in your incompleteness.</p>
                    <p>The story that keeps beginning long after its conclusion.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In HTML, there are things called 'void' elements, like <code>img</code> because it doesn't have a closing tag. Another example is <code>hr</code> which creates horizontal lines. | (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a> --- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250414054114/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archived</a>)</li>

Described as a romantic screwball comedy... Exactly as written. The best way to go into this film is knowing nothing about it except the above.

                <p>Reflections from attending the Mildura Zine Fair in July 2024: my first zine fair and the first time I'd ever printed my zines.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't sell yourself short. People will like your zines!</li>
                    <li>Bring zines to trade as an excuse for interesting conversations.</li>
                    <li>Use the resources you have around you.</li>
                    <li>Make zines on paper and clean them up and arrange them digitally.</li>
                    <li>Print folded zines double-sided so there's an interesting surprise on the non-content side.</li>
                    <li>You can sew bindings for zines with a sewing machine.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://smallzinevolcano.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Zine Volcano</a> accepts free zines for distribution in Melbourne and surrounds.</li>
                    <li>Photocopying A4 (single-sided black and white) is cheapest.</li>
                    <li>Zines can be anything and everything!</li>

                <p>In late December 2024, I attended an Are.na <a href="https://www.are.na/editorial/gifting-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Channel As Gift</a> workshop hosted by <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurel Schwulst</a>. Such a fascinating idea! These are my notes from attending.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gifting as a verb is more nourishing than the noun.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.are.na/laurel-schwulst/channel-as-gift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gift giving</a> is often separated as its own love language, but you could argue all other love languages involve giving a gift.</li>
                    <li>Attention and time are the ingredients for a good gift. Being a good gift giver is about listening, appreciating, and considering. You make connections between disparate things and the people you love.</li>
                    <li>Living with the intention of generosity is gift giving at its core. Even something an email can be a gift: putting in effort shows you care.</li>
                    <li>A wonderful gift is a Venn diagram of what you and the recipient enjoy. A moment of connection often becomes more important than the material thing.</li>
                    <li>Thoughtful digital gifts: a memory capsule of photos, a playlist, a reader of recommended articles or books, summarizing your shared existence, an imaginary museum, reasons they're loved, and a to-do list of fun activities</li>
                    <li>Gifting as an infinite game is a constant back-and-forth, a way of life.</li>
                </ul>

Eight buttons are arranged in a circular pattern, showing colorful hand-drawn designs: an Earth-like pattern in green and blue, geometric patterns in blue and green, spiral designs in light blue dots, swirling patterns in purple and blue, and various abstract designs combining zigzags, waves, and geometric shapes. The buttons appear to be about an inch in diameter and have a glossy finish from the protective covers.">

            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
