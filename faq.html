            <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
            <h3>How Did You Start Writing?</h3>
            <p>Before I grew interested in writing, I spent much time on Scratch, a kid's coding site. There, I encountered a comic about teens with elemental powers, and fell in love. It enraptured my imagination so much, I wrote the backstory for my favorite character, as a short story.</p>
            <p>It then occurred to me I could tell stories from my imagination too. Reading and writing fanfiction remains one of my great loves.</p>
            <h3>How Do You Identify?</h3>
            <p>I'm queer and neurodivergent.</p>
            <h3>What Are Your Pronouns?</h3>
            <p>He/him/his!</p>
            <h3>Where Are You From?</h3>
            <p>Regional Victoria in Australia, the lands of the Koori people.</p>
            <h2 id="about-site">About This Site</h2>
            <h3>What Can I Expect To Find On Your Site?</h3>
            <p>Many things! Some of my <a href="/stories/">short stories</a>, <a href="/notes/">notes I've taken</a>, <a href="/newsletter/">newsletter editions</a>, <a href="/zines">zines</a>, and my art: <a href="/collages">collages</a>, <a href="/digital-art">digital art</a>, <a href="/drawings">drawings</a>, <a href="/gods-eyes">gods' eyes</a>, and <a href="/photos">photos</a>. Plus, more to come!</p>
            <p>The best place to find everything is <a href="/sitemap">the sitemap</a>.</p>
            <h3>What's The Changelog?</h3>
            <p>The <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> is a record of all changes, additions, and updates made to this site. More for my references, but you might find it interesting!</p>
            <h3>What's The Colophon?</h3>
            <p>The <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> is named after the term from the same name in publishing. It's a page with brief statement about the book, the publisher, and the imprint, if applicable.</p>
            <p>Mine, in the tradition of many other personal sites, contains: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility information</li>
                <li>Checklists (for regular tasks)</li>
                <li>Credits (who I've been inspired by)</li>
                <li>Design Ethe</li>
                <li>Privacy info</li>
                <li>Technical aspects (hosting, programming languages)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What's The Shoebox?</h3>
            <p>The shoebox, another term from folks who make personal sites, means a 'category' for everything on your site you can't fit anywhere else. Like Miscellanea!</p>
            <p>I don't yet have a category page for the shoebox, but here's <a href="/sitemap#shoebox">the list on the sitemap</a>.</p>

            <h3>Are There Any Easter Eggs In Your Books?</h3>
            <p>Not at this stage, but as I work on my next series, expect several!</p>
            <h3>Are You Writing More Books?</h3>

            <p>No, though you can still purchase my books from Amazon in e-book, hardcover, and paperback.</p>
            <h3>Can I Get Your Books From The Library?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Just search your library's catalog to see if it's there. If not, you can request it to be added to the collection! Most libraries have a form on their site, and you can always ask your librarian in-person or by the contact methods they offer.</p>
            <p>And if your librarian (or you are from the collections/acquisitions department) and you can't access my books, please, <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>! I'll see how I can help.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a library card, go and get one! If you can't get one, sign up for an account on the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>! All my books and zines are available to read there.</p>
            <h3>Can I Use Your Books For My Book Club?</h3>
            <p>Of course! All my books are available for your library to order in e-book and print format. If you'd like to purchase them directly, regardless of format, <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>. You'll get a bulk discount! </p>
            <h3>Do You Have Any Book Recommendations?</h3>
            <p>I have an entire site full! Visit my book blog, <a href="https://roadlessread.com">Road Less Read</a>, for my favorite reads in fantasy, non-fiction, romance, science fiction, and young adult.</p>
            <p>And if you'd like a specific recommendation, you're welcome to <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>.</p>
            <h3>Do You Have Signed Copies Available?</h3>
            <p>While I don't have the capacity to offer print versions, electronic signed copies are coming soon! Or, you can always <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a> to ask a custom message.</p>
            <h3>In What Formats Are Your Books Available?</h3>
            <p>So far, e-book, hardcover, and paperback. Large print paperback and hardback coming soon!</p>
            <h3>What Inspires Your Stories?</h3>
            <p>Great question! Many things, but mostly song lyrics, other books, film, strange concepts, snippets of conversation, and things I notice while walking.</p>
            <h3>Where Can I Find Content Warnings For Your Books?</h3>
            <p>On my <a href="/books">books page</a>. And if I've missed anything, please, <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>!</p>
            <h3>Where Can I Purchase Your Books?</h3>
            <p>There are many places! The best is via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zacharykai">Ko-Fi</a> or <a href="https://shop.zacharykai.net/">Payhip</a>. You can also visit my <a href="/books">books page</a> which displays all my published books and their respective purchase links. </p>

            <h2 id="other">Other Questions</h2>
            <h3>Do You Accept Guest Posts?</h3>
            <p>No, I don't. I appreciate you asking, though! However, if you'd like to collaborate on something, read the answer to the question below.</p>
            <h3>Do You Have A Newsletter?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I do! It's called Wandering Worlds, and I publish it monthly. You can follow along via <a href="/assets/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>, receive it <a href="https://lunaseeker.substack.com/subscribe">as an email</a>, or read it in your Substack app. I also archive each edition <a href="/newsletters/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Each edition includes what I've been making, thinking about, reading, and planning to do next. It also includes interesting tidbits, links, books, and whatever else I think you might enjoy. As Robin Sloan says about <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/">his excellent newsletter</a>, <em>"It ranges widely, across books and media and modern life, and I always try to make it feel like a note from a friend."</em></p>
            <h3>Do You Collaborate With Others? How Can I Get Involved?</h3>
            <p>So glad you asked! If you'd like to write a post with me, have me write the script for your comic or the lyrics for your song, or anything else you might find interesting to do together...</p>
            <p>Please, <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>! I'd love to see what you want to make.</p>
            <h3>What's The Best Way To Support You?</h3>
            <p>How very kind of you! If you're the reading sort (or your friends and/or loved ones are) you can purchase my books and zines directly from my stores on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zacharykai/shop">Ko-Fi</a> and <a href="https://shop.zacharykai.net">Payhip</a>. You can also order them from wherever you like to get books, or request your library get them in!</p>
            <p>If you've read and enjoyed my books (or have constructive criticism I should know about) please leave a review on your favorite store, your socials and/or your website (if you have them!) I appreciate all feedback, positive or constructive. Bonus points for both!</p>
            <p>If you like my writing and want to follow along, you can receive my monthly newsletter by <a href="/assets/rss.xml">RSS</a>, <a href="https://lunaseeker.substack.com/subscribe">email</a>, in your Substack app, or just checking <a href="/newsletter/">this page</a> every so often for new issues.</p>
            <p>And, if you'd like to send me funds for... (well, water, as boring as it sounds, I don't drink anything else) you can do so on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zacharykai">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
            <h3>Where Can I Find You Online?</h3>
            <p>I'm on <a href="https://www.are.na/zachary-kai/channels">Are.na</a>, <a href="https://amazon.com/author/zacharykai">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54284542.Zachary_Kai">Goodreads</a>, the <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Zacharykai.net">Indieweb</a>, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/@zacharykai">Internet Archive</a>, and <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zacharykai">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="webweaving">Webweaving</h2>
            <h3>When You Discover Sites You Like, How Do You Know When There Are New Posts?</h3>
            <p>I list them in <a href="https://zacharykai.net/blogroll">my blogroll</a>. I recommend an RSS Reader like <a href="https://www.commafeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CommaFeed</a>. RSS Readers track new posts on sites for you!</p>
            <h3>Which Site Host Do You Use/Recommend?</h3>
            <p>I use WPX. NeoCities is free but uses their domain (example.neocities.org) unless you pay for a custom one. I'd recommend renting your domain. Another free option with custom domains is Netlify, but it's more technical. You need to connect it to a GitHub folder, and it automatically updates your site when you make changes.</p>
            <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
            <h3>Do You Have Advice For Aspiring Writers?</h3>
            <p>Yes, of course! Here's what I've found useful, but remember, as <a href="https://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a> said: <em>"Some advice can be a vice. Take what you can use, and leave the rest."</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carry a notebook (or a notes app on your phone) and write your ideas down as you think of them. Everything. Always. You never know the connections future you might draw.</li>
                <li>Related to the above, keep a 'spark file' or whatever you'd like to call it. As long as it's a list where you write down ideas for future projects.</li>
                <li>Have a few work-in-progress on the go at once.</li>
                <li>Finish things, and put them out in the world. Bravery is hard to come by, but it can be learned. And constructive criticism is the fastest way to improve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The beauty of writing is I still consider myself a perpetual student. Everyone is! </p>
            <h3>How Do You Overcome Creative Challenges?</h3>
            <p>I'll be honest with you. I didn't write much at all in 2023-2024. Because I allowed 'writers block' and 'lack of inspiration' to get the better of me. I don't wait for the muse to come anymore. I just sit down and do the work. It'll all get done eventually.</p>
            <h3>What's Your Writing Process Like?</h3>
            <p>When writing The Mara Files (which took five years) most of that time was spent on... revision. Because I had no idea where the story was going when I started, and would find deep gaping holes with each version I drafted. So I never wanted to do that again.</p>
            <p>Now I plan out the book and create a rough codex before I begin, and add to the outline and codex as I go. It saves much time, and allows me to get to and stay with the fun part (the actual prose writing) much quicker. The story does change as I go along, though. It's inevitable!</p>
            <h2>My Question Isn't Answered Here!</h2>

            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
