            <h2 id="official">Official Bio</h2>
            <p>Zachary Kai is a queer writer and avowed generalist who creates with unwavering purpose. Between crafting science fiction about resilient souls in the stars, making zines, and collecting skills like trading cards, he sends letters to strangers who often become friends.</p>
            <p>Though Australian by birth, he crafts tales with American spelling and British punctuation: a linguistic and world wanderer. He previously wrote as Leo Flynn. The internet remains his livelihood and lifeline, and he documents his existence on his site.</p>
            <p>His work has been featured in Austin Kleon's newsletter, the Bold Magazine, Dense Discovery, Good Internet Magazine, Stark Reflections, the Internet Phone Book, the Rebel Author Podcast, and The Art Of Noticing. He's been interviewed on Yarra Valley FM about his zines.</p>

I  archive each edition <a href="/newsletters">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>Each edition includes what I've been making, thinking about, reading, and planning to do next. It also includes interesting tidbits, links, books, and whatever else I think you might enjoy. As Robin Sloan says about <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/">his excellent newsletter</a>, <em>"It ranges widely, across books and media and modern life, and I always try to make it feel like a note from a friend."</em></p>

                            <p>Before I grew interested in writing, I spent much time on Scratch, a kid's coding site. There, I encountered a comic about teens with elemental powers, and fell in love. It enraptured my imagination so much, I wrote the backstory for my favorite character, as a short story.</p>
                            <p>It occurred to me I could tell stories from my imagination too. Reading and writing fanfiction remains one of my great loves.</p>

                            <p>I use WPX. NeoCities is free but uses their domain (example.neocities.org) unless you pay for a custom one. I'd recommend renting your domain. Another free option with custom domains is Netlify, but it's more technical. You need to connect it to a GitHub folder, and it automatically updates your site when you make changes.</p>

                            <summary>Do You Have Advice For Aspiring Writers?</summary>
                            <p>Yes, of course! Here's what I've found useful, but remember, as <a href="https://austinkleon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin Kleon</a> said: <em>"Some advice can be a vice. Take what you can use, and leave the rest."</em></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Carry a notebook (or a notes app on your phone) and write your ideas down as you think of them. Everything. Always. You never know the connections future you might draw.</li>
                                <li>Related to the above, keep a 'spark file' or whatever you'd like to call it. As long as it's a list where you write down ideas for future projects.</li>
                                <li>Have a few work-in-progress on the go at once.</li>
                                <li>Finish things, and put them out in the world. Bravery is hard to come by, but it can be learned. And constructive criticism is the fastest way to improve.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The beauty of writing is I still consider myself a perpetual student. Everyone is!</p>

                            <summary>How Do You Overcome Creative Challenges?</summary>
                            <p>I'll be honest with you. I didn't write much at all in 2023-2024. Because I allowed 'writers block' and 'lack of inspiration' to get the better of me. I don't wait for the muse to come anymore. I just sit down and do the work. It'll all get done eventually.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary>What's Your Writing Process Like?</summary>
                            <p>When writing The Mara Files (which took five years) most of that time was spent on... revision. Because I had no idea where the story was going when I started, and would find deep gaping holes with each version I drafted. So I never wanted to do that again.</p>
                            <p>Now I plan out the book and create a rough codex before I begin, and add to the outline and codex as I go. It saves much time, and allows me to get to and stay with the fun part (the actual prose writing) much quicker. The story does change as I go along, though. It's inevitable!</p>

            <h2 id="more">More About Me</h2>
            <p>I run <a href="/workshops">group workshops</a> on drawing in company, creative writing, worldbuilding, and zine-making (which you can book!)</p>
            <p>I refuse to die without making something useful and I aim to make a positive difference in the life of creative queer folk through words.</p>
            <p>If I choose one word to describe myself besides queer, it's 'generalist.' My many skills include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amateur knitting in practice, advanced knitting in theory.</li>
                <li>Amateur gardening: repotting, watering, weeding.</li>
                <li>Backstage crewing for theatre productions: being a stagehand, bumping in/out, making props, microphone management, set construction, spiking, sound. I've done six shows, and hopefully will do many more.</li>
                <li>Encyclopedic yet hyperspecialized knowledge: in consumer technology history, pop culture, and the Star Wars universe.</li>
                <li>Recipe improvisation: I can create a meal with anything you have in the fridge and pantry.</li>
                <li>Shoddy hand sewing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Country</strong></p>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
