                <p id="top" class="p-summary">Hi! I'm Zachary Kai: 20-something, queer (he/him,) and neurodivergent. I love reading, making, learning, listening to music, and traveling. I write fiction about a life in the stars.</p>
                <p><strong>I'm actively seeking new remote work opportunities! Here's my <a href="/cv">CV/resume</a>. If I'd be a good fit for your organization or project, <a href="/hello">contact me</a></strong>.</p>
                <p>I'm Australian, and oscillate between living there and overseas. Now? I'm in North Macedonia.</p>

                <h2 id="more">More About Me</h2>
                <p>I run <a href="/workshops">group workshops</a> on drawing in company, creative writing, worldbuilding, and zine-making (which you can book!)</p>
                <p>I refuse to die without making something useful and I aim to make a positive difference in the life of creative queer folk through words.</p>
                <p>If I choose one word to describe myself besides queer, it's 'generalist.' My many skills include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amateur knitting in practice, advanced knitting in theory.</li>
                    <li>Amateur gardening: repotting, watering, weeding.</li>
                    <li>Backstage crewing for theatre productions: being a stagehand, bumping in/out, making props, microphone management, set construction, spiking, sound. I've done six shows, and hopefully will do many more.</li>
                    <li>Encyclopedic yet hyperspecialized knowledge: in consumer technology history, pop culture, and the Star Wars universe.</li>
                    <li>Recipe improvisation: I can create a meal with anything you have in the fridge and pantry.</li>
                    <li>Shoddy hand sewing.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Adore the history, culture, and the art of making food. Still, I prefer subsisting on veggies, nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu.</li>

                    <li>The internet is my livelihood, friendships, joys, curiosities... Without it, who am I?</li>
                    <li>Though I'm Australian, I write using American spelling, and British punctuation.</li>
