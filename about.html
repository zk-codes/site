            <h2 id="official"> Official Bio</h2>
            <p>Zachary Kai is a queer writer and avowed generalist who creates with unwavering purpose. Between crafting science fiction about resilient souls in the stars, making zines, and collecting skills like trading cards, he sends letters to strangers who often become friends.</p>
            <p>Though Australian by birth, he crafts tales with American spelling and British punctuation: a linguistic and world wanderer. He previously wrote as Leo Flynn. The internet remains his livelihood and lifeline, and he documents his existence on his site.</p>
            <p>His work has been featured in the Bold Magazine, Dense Discovery, Good Internet Magazine, Stark Reflections, the Internet Phone Book, and the Rebel Author Podcast. He's been interviewed on Yarra Valley FM about his zines.</p>

            <h2 id="more">More About Me</h2>
            <p>I run <a href="/workshops">group workshops</a> on drawing in company, creative writing, worldbuilding, and zine-making (which you can book!)</p>
            <p>I refuse to die without making something useful and I aim to make a positive difference in the life of creative queer folk through words.</p>
            <p>If I choose one word to describe myself besides queer, it's 'generalist.' My many skills include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amateur knitting in practice, advanced knitting in theory.</li>
                <li>Amateur gardening: repotting, watering, weeding.</li>
                <li>Backstage crewing for theatre productions: being a stagehand, bumping in/out, making props, microphone management, set construction, spiking, sound. I've done six shows, and hopefully will do many more.</li>
                <li>Encyclopedic yet hyperspecialized knowledge: in consumer technology history, pop culture, and the Star Wars universe.</li>
                <li>Recipe improvisation: I can create a meal with anything you have in the fridge and pantry.</li>
                <li>Shoddy hand sewing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>As long as I'm typing in text or markdown files, I'm happy.</li>
                <li>Adore the history, culture, and the art of making food. Still, I prefer subsisting on veggies, nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu.</li>
                <li>Always listening to music. Despite listening to my favorite songs thousands of times, I hardly grow tired!</li>
                <li>I alphabetize (almost) everything when organizing.</li>

                <li>Love the smell of coffee, can't stand the taste.</li>
                <li>Saw A New Hope in 2015 and it changed everything.</li>
                <li>Started sending letters, art, and ephemera to strangers in 2020, and I haven't stopped. Some of my dearest friends are penpals.</li>
                <li>The internet is my livelihood, friendships, joys, curiosities... Without it, who am I?</li>
                <li>Though I'm Australian, I write using American spelling, and British punctuation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="wants">Wants</h2>
            <p >A list of intentions, desires, and dare I say goals. Inspired by the lovely <a href="https://gkeenan.co/wants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keenan</a> and <a href="https://kayserifserif.place/intentions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine</a>.</p>

                <li>To see a beloved band live, in all their human glory.</li>
                <li>To fall in love with the world (over and over again).</li>
                <li>To make poetry without succumbing to a terrifying fear.</li>
                <li>To help make the poetic web.</li>
                <li>To read everything beautiful I can get my hands on.</li>
                <li>To wonder at existence and all within it.</li>
                <li>To live without shame.</li>
            </ul>
