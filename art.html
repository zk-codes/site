Features a vibrant red parrot as the focal point, surrounded by a garden-like arrangement of cut-out flowers including coral hibiscus, purple asters, and yellow daffodils. Two detailed blue pen sketches of a single eye appear, dated 2.2.24. Small fleur-de-lis symbols in navy and gold accent the piece. Along the bottom runs a delicate border of autumn leaves in watercolor, ranging from green to burning red. A pink rain cloud hovers in the top left corner.">

Features a large striped shape framed by scalloped dots, resembling a mysterious underwater cave or portal. A winding blue river or stream cuts through a field of varying sized black dots. The 'Wooden Door Cafe' logo card sits center-right, surrounded by marine elements - tiny seashells, starfish, and cornflowers in deep blue. The design suggests a dreamlike underwater landscape with geometric patterns.">

A winding river in shades of blue and purple curves through the scene, while angular mountains peek in from the corner. The style is loose and atmospheric, with visible pencil strokes creating texture throughout.">

Each color band contains distinct shapes - the red sections have a cityscape-like silhouette, the blue bands contain geometric blocks, and the green sections ripple like waves or mountains. The colors are bold and saturated, with a satisfying rhythm to the repeating patterns.">

One palm tree in the middle bends playfully to support a stick figure reading a book. The sun sets over a wavy ocean horizon, while delicate lines create texture in the sky and water. The drawing has a gentle, storybook quality with careful attention to the palm fronds' feathery details.">
