            <p>I spent a lifetime telling myself I did but like cooking and how hard it was, so, of course, learning to bake was pointless.</p>
            <p>It would be even more difficult, and everything I made would be a failure.</p>
            <p>So, thoughts became real, and I avoided the oven at all costs. It was a vengeful creature, after all, and if I so much as looked at it, why, I'd burn down the kitchen, perhaps even the house!</p>
            <p>Except... what if that wasn't true? What then?</p>
            <p>I woke up one day with the conviction that the oven would scare me no longer. I would show it I could bake!</p>
            <p>Of course... I've had a few failures. Biscuits that almost didn't cook because the dough was too short, a banana cake I took out of the pan too soon to cool on a wire rack which collapsed in on itself and became banana crumble... And each time it happened, I was ready to quit.</p>
            <p>But I was a big boy now, and I would never surrender! Since then I've made biscuits, carrot cakes with frosting, roasted veggies, and more. And I continue to learn.</p>
            <p>Who knew baking could teach me so much about life itself?</p>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Country</strong></p>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
