            <h2 id="burn">Don't Burn Too Bright</h2>
            <p>In a galaxy still smoldering from wars past, three souls dance on the precipice of redemption and loss. Don't Burn Too Bright is a poetic sci-fi odyssey that defies conventional boundaries, speaking to the lost and searching hearts of our generation.</p>
            <p>Xander walks a tightrope between person and machine. Once a living weapon, he's now a fallen clockwork angel stitched back together from the ashes of his demise. Everyone thinks he died three years ago, including the only two people who gave his existence meaning: Gwen, his fierce partner-in-arms, and Isadora, whose introspective wisdom once anchored his personhood.</p>
            <p>Haunted by worlds they failed to save and life without their beloved friend, Gwen and Isadora seek oblivion through the flickering Great Gates. Xander catches them just as they fall through, catapulting all three into an unknown future.</p>
            <p>In a verdant city thrumming with energy, they face the weight of their shared past and the chasm three years carved between them. Xander's unaffected exterior conceals a tortured soul, Isadora battles her demons, and Gwen struggles to reconcile the warrior she was with the person she longs to become.</p>
            <p>Told through Isadora's poignant journal entries, this imaginative tale is for dreamers, outcasts, and anyone caught between who they were and who they might become. A stardust-strewn path home.</p>
            <p>This isn't a story about the end. This is what happens after.</p>

            <p>From a deaf assassin navigating unfamiliar worlds to a gardener rebuilding civilization one seed at a time, each story In Echoes of Distant Stars is an intimate exploration of what it means to be alive in an impossibly vast universe.</p>
            <p>Drawing on literary sensibilities while embracing contemporary science fiction, these tales are portraits of resilience, redemption, and connection. Broken spaceships become sanctuaries, hostile planets offer second chances, and the stars themselves become characters in stories of survival and rebirth.</p>
            <p>Perfect for readers who love Ursula K. Le Guin's depth and Becky Chambers' heart, Echoes of Distant Stars reminds us even in space's darkest corners, the heart of the people continues to beat.</p>

            <p>Once the respected leader of the galaxy’s elite peacekeeping force, Mara Keres now rots in prison, betrayed by the one she trusted most.</p>
            <p>She faces a critical choice: a dubious offer of escape or a life behind bars.</p>
            <p>Before she can decide, her betrayer, Kottura, reveals her terrifying ambitions. With the galaxy in shambles, it needs a new iron-fisted leader. Mara is the perfect linchpin.</p>
            <p>Hunted by mercenaries, and outsmarting Kottura's plots, Mara wants to ignore the galaxy's plight. But her freedom hinges on its liberation.</p>
            <p>Will she reclaim her honor, or be consumed by the shadows she battles?</p>
