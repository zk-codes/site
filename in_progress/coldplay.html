<p id="tribute-info">My music journey started how most's do: listening to the tracks their parents love. For me, that was lots of late-80s, early-90s, and 2000s alternative.</p>
<p>My second biggest source of music was primary school. Instead of bells to announce the beginning and end of different periods throughout the day, they'd play pop music from the Billboard 100. Over and over again until I got sick of it.</p>
<p>My tastes were pleasurable at the time but bland: mostly Colbie Colbie Caillat and Adele. Convinced only 'new' music was good.</p>
<p>An old friend in the same grade level had far more knowledge and a willingness to try different things while I was stuck in conformity. One of my biggest struggles was, and remains to this day, is allowing things a chance before forming an opinion.</p>
<p>He insisted, over and over, I would like Coldplay. And again and again, what was my response? No! That music is for old people! (Keeping in mind, of course, the band is only four years older than me.)</p>
<p>He never gave up and I never gave in.</p>
<p>So what changed?</p>
<p>Moving overseas of all things.</p>
<p>Perhaps my perception is skewed, but Coldplay was everywhere in Mexico. Blaring from street corners, snippets from buses as they dropped off passengers, barely audible in the background in resturants...</p>
<p>But what really changed my mind was the constant exposure thanks to some new friends. They played it on repeat, whether I liked it or not.</p>
<p>And to my 'set-in-my-ways' horror... I did.</p>
<p>That was ten years ago. I still like them, even if I fall into the trap Regurgiator so aptly described in their song, <em>I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.</em></p>
<p>And old friend, if you're out there? You were always right.</p>
