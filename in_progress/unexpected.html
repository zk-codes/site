<h2 id="amanda">Amanda Montell's Author Talk (23 Jan 2025)</h2>
<p>Attending this (online) was a delight. Her answers to the moderator and audience's questions were insightful, caring and enthusiastic. An incisive thinker!</p>
<ul>
<li>She got her start in socio-linguistics (studying language in culture/society). She wanted to become a dialect coach or a pop linguist.</li>
<li>Combining your interests creates the most interesting work.</li>
<li>Switching between writing non-fiction and fiction provides constant inspiration and interest.</li>
<li>Humor makes heavier topics easier to approach, but balance delight and sensitivity.</li>
<li>Sometimes writers use humor as a defense to their detriment.</li>
<li>Asking a college professor for their reading assignments in a subject you want to study gives you a great starting point for research.</li>
<li>Make the research process interesting to get yourself excited about a writing project.</li>
<li>Interviews with experts + unexpected fields of knowledge + cultural relevancy + social commentary creates fascinating creative non-fiction.</li>
<li>Information overload and cognitive biases are on a dramatic collision course; critical thinking and letting go of needing to be right combats the onslaught.</li>
<li>Skepticism needs to apply to your thoughts.</li>
<li>While optimism won't fix your life, but it'll make it much easier to live.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creativity-in-drought-research-panel">Creativity In Drought Research Panel (24 Aug 2024)</h2>
<p>Went to this in person. A fascinating discussion that turned into a conversation with the audience, hence why I didn't take many notes!</p>
<ul>
<li>The visual tropes of irrigated settlements create a romantic notion of drought immunity.</li>
<li>People assume they have control over nature: they can make the desert bloom.</li>
<li>Apiarists sometimes hire out their bees to pollinate fruit and nut trees.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary research creates the richest insights and gives you a deeper understanding: combine the humanities and the sciences for the best results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ewf-x-sinister-wisdom-panel">EWF x Sinister Wisdom Panel (9 Sep 2024)</h2>
<p>This panel, hosted as part of the Emerging Writers Festival 2024 was a conversation with folks involved in Sinister Wisdom, the longest running lesbian literary journal.</p>
<p>Featuring: Pelaya Arapakis, Parla Tejada, Yasmin Tambiah, Joan Nestle, and  Julie Enszer. </p>
<ul>
<li>Transnationalism bridges borders: real and invented. Hope for the future.</li>
<li>The more cultures involved in a collaborative creative project, the richer the result.</li>
<li>Publishing texts for an international audience requires humility and curiosity.</li>
<li>Doing it for the love allows greater experimentation.</li>
<li>Archiving as an art form.</li>
<li>When creating a print publication, using index cards to represent the working structure is a great way to design.</li>
<li>Cross-cultural exchange is a rich opportunity for inspiring new writing.</li>
<li>Argumentative discussions as productive disagreements.</li>
<li>Generational divides are boundaries made to be broken.</li>
<li>When making connections with elders, don't assume there'll be difficulties, but recognize there'll be learning moments.</li>
<li>To learn is to listen without judgement.</li>
<li>Comparable experiences allow for addressing most differences.</li>
<li>Fear of the unknown kills the chance for creative collaboration.</li>
<li>Published works break time, they freeze it, and exist outside it.</li>
<li>Every time someone picks up and reads a published work, they're experiencing it for the first time. Keep them in mind alongside your longtime readers and those you write for.</li>
<li>Writers need a place to write, a home to send their words to.</li>
<li>Change for a brighter future is never finished. The work must always go on.</li>
<li>Independent publishing fills in the gaps left by mainstream efforts. The more voices in print we have, the richer the culture.</li>
<li>There's no such thing as too many words published.</li>
<li>Writing as a conduit for new possibilities.</li>
<li>Older folks being visible in our society means everything to younger people with shared experiences.</li>
<li>In intergenerational friendships, you can look to the future and the past.</li>
<li>Life is a paradox: hope as tragedy, tragedy as hope. Everything changes, yet stays the same.</li>
<li>We stay alive through celebrating difference.</li>
<li>Stay open to everyday magic.</li>
<li>Be open-minded, but not so much so your brain falls out. It's a balance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="liane-moriarty">Liane Moriarty's Author Talk (22 Sep 2024)</h2>
<p>This writer, one of the world's bestsellers, is from Australia! I haven't read her books but found her craft and publishing perspectives fascinating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early encouragement means everything in creativity. Unfounded criticism kills it.</li>
<li>Often the most suspenseful stories come from taking one ordinary thing and looking at it differently or adding surrealism.</li>
<li>Writing word by word without a plan is thrilling but also enticing in its uncertainty.</li>
<li>Tracking words written and combining it with intermittent rewards equals excellent motivation.</li>
<li>Write the draft in full and keep a list of things to fix in to avoid distraction.</li>
<li>Themes in written works aren't planned, they emerge.</li>
<li>Recording your search history can be a fascinating exercise in personal archiving.</li>
<li>When creating a character, start with an interesting attribute or two.</li>
<li>Characters evolve over the writing. You can add consistency later.</li>
<li>Words have incredible power. Use them wisely.</li>
<li>Never use the same character name twice in the same book, ensure sure no two characters' names start with the same initial.</li>
<li>Give people the chance to bid to have a name of their choosing in a book-in-progress in a charity auction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to the generous founders of this conference for publishing the recordings online. How I appreciated hearing from the speakers.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not just about the work. We want to be seen. We want to live on after we die.</li>
<li>Appreciate everything. Stop and take the time to experience something.</li>
<li>Tell everyone how much you appreciate them and their work. Send the nice email now before it's too late.</li>
<li>Put up a portfolio. Don't throw yourself or your work away. Let people see what you did.</li>
<li>Go down all the research rabbit holes. You never know what you might discover.</li>
<li>Save the art you love. For yourself and the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="charlie-jane-anders">Charlie Jane Anders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Daydreaming is the opposite of doomscrolling. It's crucial work.</li>
<li>Learned helplessness is the fastest way to destroy hope.</li>
<li>There's never nothing you can do. There's always something positive you can contribute.</li>
<li>Community is hope for the future.</li>
<li>Creating community creates a consensus reality: a future we can look forward to.</li>
<li>Create the reality you want to see in the world and you never have to do it alone.</li>
<li>Futurism needs community, vice versa.</li>
<li>There's this idea events are temporary, and the written word is forever when the opposite can be true. And that's not a bad thing.</li>
<li>Recognizing your art may not last forever takes the pressure off. Experiment. Make it strange.</li>
<li>What's progress if not finding new stories?</li>
<li>When you're freed from speaking only to posterity, you're free to speak to the moment: Creating the future for yourself and others here now.</li>
<li>Wanting certainty is fragile. The only way to survive is to fall in love with being wrong.</li>
<li>The hardest things to talk about are the most important. Be brave, and step up.</li>
<li>Creativity is communal. Keep expanding the circle.</li>
<li>Getting uncomfortable is how we grow.</li>
<li>Unrelenting grimness is unrealistic.</li>
<li>Nothing makes sense. And that's okay. We need silliness.</li>
<li>Kindness saves us. It's why we're here.</li>
<li>Embrace gentle absurdity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Journalism often covers the smaller parts of a bigger story: piecing it all together is difficult but necessary work. It's called evidence-based journalism of the imagination.</li>
<li>Writing good non-fiction often means finding new and novel sources than anything else in the canon table, because this allows for richer reporting.</li>
<li>Nonfiction about societal problems is a collective narrative, showing how a central protagonist POV destroys the complexity.</li>
<li>Sense-making is synthesizing.</li>
<li>We can always make better choices by using our moral information.</li>
<li>Creativity is always the work of many.</li>
<li>Feeding the system of attention-grabbing is the antithesis of nuanced rigor.</li>
<li>Rules for a sane existence online: no arguing with strangers, don't become a pundit, cultivate readers, not fans, no savior complex, acknowledge and uplift community, act the part even if you don't feel it, use power well.</li>
<li>Use your insights to tell the stories that aren't being told.</li>
<li>Journalism channels empathy, and brings words to the indescribable.</li>
<li>The people who read a piece aren't the only ones who're affected by them. Words start conversations, opening the door to understanding and change.</li>
