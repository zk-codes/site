            <p>I'm writing this from Albania. Why? Good question. It's just where I'm currently living, so wherever I go, the words follow.</p>
            <p>I’m writing this from Albania. Why? Good question. It’s just where I’m currently living, so wherever I go, the words follow.</p>
            <p>Until Joe gave me this title to write from, I hadn’t considered how my experience of living in different countries affects my words. But it does. Why wouldn’t it?</p>
            <p>So I thought about how it might make me a better writer. Is it because it gives me material to work from? Possibly. Because it gives me a different perspective? I’d say so? Or, because writing helps me process uncertainty, which moving to a new place brings with it in droves? Of course!</p>
            <p>The most impactful thing, though, is it forces me to pay attention.</p>
            <p>At home (which I count as whatever domicile I’m currently occupying, but for this exercise, I’ll say my birthplace in Australia) I’ve realized I exist on autopilot. Same everything.</p>
            <p>Yet...whenever I arrive in a new place, every detail demands my notice.</p>
            <p>It’s overwhelming in the best possible way, and it’s writing fuel.</p>
            <p>If I go about level deeper into this inquiry, I realize something else: travel strips away many of the narratives I tell myself about who I am. At home, I’m just like everyone else, in most ways. In Albania, I’m the strange guy with terrible pronunciation trying to order bread.</p>
            <p>That dissolution of identity? That’s where the good stuff lives!</p>
            <p>And then comes my favorite part of this hyperawareness. The endless questioning.</p>
            <p>Why do people here gesture like that when they talk? What would it feel like to grow up speaking a language that uses different sounds? How does geography shape personality?</p>
            <p>I don’t have the answers, but wondering leads to writing.</p>
            <p>I’ve been to several countries, and each has left traces in my work.</p>
            <p>Travel reminds me the world is vast and strange, yet so small. Full of folks living different lives with different assumptions about how things work.</p>
            <p>That’s the engine. Not the locations or the moments, but the constant reminder that there are infinite ways to be human in this world.</p>
            <p>And infinite stories waiting to be told.</p>

            <h2>Acknowledgement Of Country</h2>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
