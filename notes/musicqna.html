            <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
                <h3 id="q1">1. What Are Five Of Your Favorite Albums?</h3>
                    <p>That's difficult! I'll admit I don't listen to many albums, but in no particular order, they'd be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being Funny In A Foreign Language by The 1975</li>
                        <li>Born And Raised by John Mayer</li>
                        <li>Days Of Thunder by The Midnight</li>
                        <li>Beneath The Skin by Of Monsters And Men</li>
                        <li>Mylo Xyloto by Coldplay</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 id="q2">2. What Are Five Of Your Favorite Songs?</h3>
                    <p>This changes depending on my mood, the time of day, and the year, but right now:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I Had Some Help by Post Malone</li>
                        <li>Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America by The 1975</li>
                        <li>Papercuts by Illy</li>
                        <li>Nosedive by Post Malone</li>
                        <li>Stardew by Purity Ring</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 id="q3">3. Favorite Instrument(s)?</h3>
                    <p>I love the sound of the xylophone, the saxophone, a steel-string guitar, janky piano, and a good old-fashioned drum beat. Bass guitars are so underused!</p>
                <h3 id="q4">4. What Song Or Album Are You Currently Listening To?</h3>
                    <p>The most recent song I listened to is Coachella by LovelyTheBand.</p>
                <h3 id="q5">5. Do You Listen To The Radio? If So, How Often?</h3>
                    <p>Hardly ever! If I'm in Australia, and I'm listening, it's always ABC Classic FM. I love the weekly evening program Screen Sounds.</p>
                <h3 id="q6">6. How Often Do You Listen To Music?</h3>
                    <p>Almost every day, multiple times a day. While working, writing, doing household chores...</p>
                <h3 id="q7">7. How Often Do You Discover Music? And How Do You Discover Music?</h3>
                    <p>Not as often as I'd like! When I do make the effort... Most song recommendations come from browsing folks' websites and giving them a go or from family.</p>
                <h3 id="q8">8. What's A Song Or Album You Enjoy You Wish Had More Recognition?</h3>
                    <p>Context by Explo, an EP released last year. Beautifully chaotic avant-garde art pop.</p>
                <h3 id="q9">9. What's Your Favorite Song Of All Time?</h3>
                    <p>Goodness, what a hardest question! Probably... Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall by Coldplay.</p>
                <h3 id="q10">10. Has Your Taste In Music Evolved Over The Years?</h3>
                    <p>It has! I had a phase where I only listened to Colbie Caillat and Adele, but I haven't done so for years. I used to love Clean Bandit, but don't anymore. Not sure why!</p>
                    <p>My musical tastes (as I've gotten more comfortable with admitting I enjoy genres like pop and country/western) have expanded, and for that, I'm grateful. I realize now I'll listen to almost everything from metal to country, provided it has pop sensibilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Country</strong></p>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
