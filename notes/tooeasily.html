                <!-- Introduction -->
                <p id="top" class="p-summary">I fall in love. Often. All the time.</p>
                <p>Not just with the usual suspects: film, music, books...but people. Strangers across the street, brief acquaintances, friends. And I don’t mean it in the conventional sense. The way I experience this concept has always been difficult to put into words.</p>
                <p>Here’s me trying to do that.</p>
                <p>Let’s start with the basics, because from there, you’ll see how messy things get. I’ve tried every label for my romantic inclinations (or lack thereof) I’ve found. </p>
                <p>Gay? But I like girls. Bi? Pan? Folks who’ve never labeled themselves appeal to me, yes...but these descriptors never fit right. Ace? Aro? Aro-ace? That may work, but how do I explain the heart palpitations?</p>
                <p>Do you see what I mean? The further I attempt to narrow down, the more confused I feel. The only thing I know for certain surrounding all this is I’m queer. And proud of it.</p>
                <p>And the other thing with choosing a label...is I don’t think what I feel is romantic love. I’m in my early twenties, and have I ever been kissed? Gone on a date? Had a relationship? Never. When I imagine the inevitable end and ponder if nothing on that front occurs...I don’t regret it.</p>
                <p>Yet I still appreciate beauty in folks. All the time. Almost every day.</p>
                <p>Ironic, isn’t it? My greatest passion is the written word, yet I can’t find a single one to describe these feelings. That’s the thing, though. Maybe I don’t need to.</p>
                <p>If I describe it to you, perhaps, at last, I might understand it myself.</p>
                <p>When I consider you a friend, even if we only knew each other for a few weeks, it’s almost a guarantee I think of you fondly, and often. The smallest esoteric things remind me of you. I treasure your eccentricities, your idiosyncratic lexicon, the tiny details no one else notices.</p>
                <p>You, even in a tiny way, have made me who I am today. Brought out something I never could’ve imagined, recommended something I would’ve discovered otherwise. Changing my life for the better, even if it was only in that one interaction.</p>
                <p>Can you see why, as I flail for words, I keep coming back to this concept? </p>
                <p>What is this feeling, if not love? </p>
                <p>And yet, in admitting this, I struggle. If you combine my strange vulnerabilities, a recursive, damaging storyline of forever being ‘too much’ with this deep-seated fear of the faceless opinionated public, it’s a difficult thing to reveal, or explain. </p>
                <p>It’s not romantic love, at least in the way society thinks of it. It took me a long time to realize I have no interest. Yes, I want long-lasting relationships, co-inhabitants of the same living space, that elusive found family every lonely queer kid dreams of. But I want nothing more.</p>
                <p>And at long last, I realize that’s not a bad thing. That’s just who I am.</p>
                <p>I feel things. There’s no way around that. I think until the very concept of the act itself falls apart, even when I try not to. I’m overwhelmed by the world’s haunting beauty almost daily.</p>
                <p>And in that sublime ridiculousness...perhaps it’s where I can find my strength.</p>
                <p>I don’t have to justify my existence. Knowing I’m here, queer, and willing to love is enough.</p>
