                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <p id="top" class="p-summary">I saw Ava answer these a little while ago. Because I love participating in IndieWeb-adjacent prompts, I thought I’d join in. There’s still time before the year’s end if you want to write yours!</p>
                    <p>All credit goes to Steph Ango, who started <a href="https://github.com/kepano/40-questions" rel="noopener">asking these questions</a>, and who knew! He’s Obsidian’s current CEO. Feels appropriate, given I wrote this using that beloved software.</p>

                        <!-- Questions -->
                        <h2>Questions</h2>

                        <!-- Question 1 -->
                        <h3>What Did You Do This Year You’d Never Done Before?</h3>
                        <p>Visited several new countries, got interviewed live on radio, contributed to a printed directory, got published in an American print magazine, and featured at a writers’ festival.</p>

                        <!-- Question 2 -->
                        <h3>Did You Keep Your New Year’s Resolutions?</h3>
                        <p>Most! Some no. I suppose that’s always the way it goes.</p>

                        <!-- Question 3 -->
                        <h3>Did Anyone Close To You Give Birth?</h3>
                        <p>Not anyone I know well, but a few people in my wider circles. Many congratulations to the wonderful, joyous new parents!</p>

                        <!-- Question 4 -->
                        <h3>Did Anyone Close To You Die?</h3>
                        <p>No, and I count my good fortune for that.</p>

                        <!-- Question 5 -->
                        <h3>What Cities/States/Countries Did You Visit?</h3>
                        <p>I spent time in Spain, Turkey, Albania, North Macedonia, and Kosovo (where I write this.)</p>

                        <!-- Question 6 -->
                        <h3>What’d You Like To Have Next Year You Lacked This Year?</h3>
                        <p>More peace of mind, at least within the influences that are in my control. And more completed projects instead of half-finished or a-third-started ones!</p>

                        <!-- Question 7 -->
                        <h3>What Date(s) From This Year Remain Etched Upon Your Memory, And Why?</h3>
                        <p>Good question! I don’t remember the exact date, but getting snowed on for the first time while waiting to board a plane in February was extraordinary.</p>

                        <!-- Question 8 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Biggest Achievement Of The Year?</h3>
                        <p>It’s hard to choose! I’d say hosting two events for HTML Day 2025. Nerve-wracking, but fun!</p>

                        <!-- Question 9 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Biggest Failure?</h3>
                        <p>Not republishing The Mara Files in all the usual places, and not setting up my Ko-Fi store.</p>

                        <!-- Question 10 -->
                        <h3>What Other Hardships Did You Face?</h3>
                        <p>Apart from the usual neurodivergent and anxious person struggles, I’ve been so lucky.</p>

                        <!-- Question 11 -->
                        <h3>Did You Suffer Illness Or Injury?</h3>
                        <p>A few colds, sure, but nothing serious. Again, I’m almost terrified by how fortunate I am.</p>

                        <!-- Question 12 -->
                        <h3>What Was The Best Thing You Bought?</h3>
                        <p>Renewed my Dense Discovery membership, and a copy of Good Internet Magazine issue one.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 13 -->
                        <h3>Whose Behavior Merited Celebration?</h3>
                        <p>All the wonderful folks on the IndieWeb and the adjacent quiet/slow/poetic web. Your kindness, willingness to share perspectives and knowledge never cease to amaze me.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 14 -->
                        <h3>Whose Behavior Made You Appalled?</h3>
                        <p>I’m…not going to answer this in any detail because I try not to talk about others in my life in public settings. Still, one thing that riles me up is the insistence the humanities don’t matter.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 15 -->
                        <h3>Where Did Most Of Your Money Go?</h3>
                        <p>Groceries, utilities, and accommodation. The building blocks of funding an existence!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 16 -->
                        <h3>What Did You Get Really, Really, Really Excited About?</h3>
                        <p>Making things on the internet. Learning about programming. Learning new things!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 17 -->
                        <h3>What Song Will Always Remind You Of This Year?</h3>
                        <p>Probably Welcome To The Plains by Wyatt Flores. Admitting I liked it allowed me to admit I enjoyed some country music. Just like when I allowed myself to acknowledge I like mainstream pop music, the earth didn’t fall out from beneath me, nor did the sky swallow me.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 18 -->
                        <h3>Compared To This Time Last Year, Are You: Happier Or Sadder? Richer Or Poorer? Healthier Or Unhealthier?</h3>
                        <p>Overall, happier, richer, and healthier. I’ve found some purpose and enjoyment in work, had a few unexpected windfalls and freelance projects, and am feeling better. I’ve given up adding salt to my food, kept at my six-days-a-week intermittent fasting, and moved more regularly.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 19 -->
                        <h3>What Do You Wish You’d Done More Of?</h3>
                        <p>Journaling. The days blur into each other as I spend most of my time working, so having something to look back on to find the bright spots and small moments would’ve been nice.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 20 -->
                        <h3>What Do You Wish You’d Done Less Of?</h3>
                        <p>Chastising myself. Listening to the harsh inner critic. Overthinking the harmful trivial.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 21 -->
                        <h3>How Are You Spending The Holidays?</h3>
                        <p>I made a fruitcake, which despite having toasted edges, was delicious! Also roasted veggies and made cauliflower cheese for the first time, and both turned out well.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 22 -->
                        <h3>Did You Fall In Love This Year?</h3>
                        <p>In the romantic department? No, I’m solitary by nature until proven otherwise.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 23 -->
                        <h3>Do You Hate Anyone Now You Didn’t Hate This Time Last Year?</h3>
                        <p>No! There are few people I detest, and I’ve never had the misfortune of knowing them.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 24 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Favorite Show?</h3>
                        <p>I watched only a little television this year: The Dragon Prince’s seventh and final season, and the limited series ‘Asterix + Obelix: The Big Fight’, so I’d say it was the latter.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 25 -->
                        <h3>What Was The Best Book You Read?</h3>
                        <p>Do I have to choose? I don’t wish to play favorites!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 26 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Greatest Musical Discovery Of The Year?</h3>
                        <p>Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, and to my surprise…Taylor Swift. I blame James.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 27 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Favorite Film?</h3>
                        <p>The Electric State. No doubt a wild difference from the source material, and the outlying opinion, but I adore its humor, the narrative threads, the heartache, and the themes.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 28 -->
                        <h3>What Was Your Favorite Meal?</h3>
                        <p>Trying traditional North Macedonian food at a local restaurant. It was fascinating being introduced to the different items, and it was amazing!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 29 -->
                        <h3>What Did You Want And Get?</h3>
                        <p>I wanted more proof of my professional experience for my resume, and I got it (and lots of ideas for improving my work) for taking several HubSpot certifications this month.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 30 -->
                        <h3>What Did You Want And Not Get?</h3>
                        <p>More mental relaxation. I’ve been stressed this year more often than not (mostly self-inflicted.)</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 31 -->
                        <h3>What Did You Do On Your Birthday?</h3>
                        <p>Contacted family and friends, which was lovely. Spent most of the day working on this site!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 32 -->
                        <h3>What One Thing Would Have Made Your Year Immeasurably More Satisfying?</h3>
                        <p>More time for futzing on the internet. Just surfing through sites, seeing what I find, making things on my website, getting new ideas, emailing people…I don’t do it as much as I’d like.</p>

                        <!-- Question 33 -->
                        <h3>How Would You Describe Your Personal Fashion This Year?</h3>
                        <p>Personal fashion? What personal fashion? I don’t know what that even means!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 34 -->
                        <h3>What Kept You Sane?</h3>
                        <p>Reading. Learning. My curiosity is endless, and while it’s overwhelming, it’s also comforting.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 35 -->
                        <h3>Which Celebrity/Public Figure Did You Admire The Most?</h3>
                        <p>Thomas Sanders, for his charm, wit, and delightful videos. Brian Merchant, for his incisive writing and never-wavering focus. Kristoffer Tjalve, for everything he does for the web.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 36 -->
                        <h3>What Political Issue Stirred You The Most?</h3>
                        <p>Minor, perhaps, yes, but the need now, more than ever, for libraries. Get a library card already!</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 37 -->
                        <h3>Who Did You Miss?</h3>
                        <p>Friends I spend lots of time with years ago, family, and friends I’ve never met in person.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 38 -->
                        <h3>Who Was The Best New Person You Met?</h3>
                        <p>The lovely proprietor of mewizard.nekoweb.org.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 39 -->
                        <h3>What Valuable Life Lesson Did You Learn This Year?</h3>
                        <p>I’m not an island, as much as I might try. I’m an animal, and that means I have needs. Humans aren’t machines! We’re creatures of flesh and blood, so I need to care for myself as such.</p>
                        
                        <!-- Question 40 -->
                        <h3>What Is A Quote That Sums Up Your Year?</h3>
                        <p>‘Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans,’ as attributed to Allen Saunders. May I learn to embrace flexibility and uncertainty in the year to come.</p>
