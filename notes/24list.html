                <p id="top" class="p-summary">Inspired by Austin Kleon's lists of things that made his year (<a href="https://austinkleon.com/2024/01/03/100-things-that-made-my-year-2023/" rel="noopener">here's his entry for 2023</a>.)</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Making my first zines in years (and having the courage to share them with the world!)</li>
                    <li>Going to my first zine fair, meeting like-hearted folks, and trading my zines.</li>
                    <li>Having my zines distributed by Sticky Institute in Melbourne and G:Zines in Geelong in Australia. Also having my zines selected for inclusion in the State Library Victoria catalog!</li>
                    <li>Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df_K7pIsfvg">this talk</a> by Cabel Sasser from the 2024 XOXO conference. So moving, but the quote <em>"Send the nice email, now. While people can still hear you."</em> especially resonated with me. So I've done just that, and plan to do many more in 2025. It's so rewarding!</li>
                    <li>And, of course, watching the rest of the fantastic talks from that conference.</li>
                    <li>Being published in a local youth magazine's annual issue for the second year in a row.</li>
                    <li>Being featured in <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/archive/316/">Issue 316</a> of one of my favorite newsletters, Dense Discovery.</li>
                    <li>Improving my baking skills and having far fewer mishaps than my attempts last year.</li>
                    <li>Spending many a walk at a billabong, and watching it change through the seasons.</li>
                    <li>Frequenting the local art gallery as the exhibitions came and went.</li>
                    <li>Watching (and photographing) the many gorgeous sunsets of semi-arid Australia.</li>
                    <li>Starting to curate and post my art on my site.</li>
                    <li>Making pin buttons for the first time (with my own artwork) thanks to the lovely volunteers and the machines at Sticky Institute.</li>
                    <li>Having perhaps the best mango sticky rice I've ever tasted.</li>
                    <li>Attending the online 'Channel As Gift' workshop hosted by Laurel Schwulst.</li>
                    <li>Discovering Are.na and all its creative potential.</li>
                    <li>Wandering the quiet corners of the web and discovering idiosyncratic delights.</li>
                    <li>Attending live performances with family, whether that be orchestral arrangements, youth talent shows, or amateur theatre productions.</li>
                    <li>Volunteering backstage for two performances after not having done so for a few years.</li>
                    <li>Helping at a local food co-op a few times.</li>
                    <li>Reading so many good books.</li>
                    <li>Attending the Mildura Writers Festival for the first time.</li>
                    <li>Virtually attending the Emerging Writers Festival and the inaugural Liminal Festival.</li>
                    <li>Learning about erasure poetry at an online workshop.</li>
                    <li>Discovering The 1975's discography.</li>
                    <li>Finding more new artists to listen to: Alisa Xayalith, Explo, Her's, Knox, Mark Ambor, Omar Apollo, Tyler Lyle, UFO UFO, Vacations, and Wave Racer.</li>
                    <li>Having plants indoors (and watching them grow.)</li>
                    <li>Learning to bake more successfully than last year.</li>
                    <li>Starting to draw again (finally!)</li>
                    <li>Re-learning how to use Krita.</li>
                    <li>Discovering it's possible to make zines digitally. </li>
                    <li>Falling in love with the internet (again.)</li>
                    <li>Attending an online author talk with the writer Liane Moriaty. </li>
                    <li>Interacting with the lovely folks who have personal websites.</li>
                    <li>And of course, making my own website. It's been so much fun. I wish I'd started sooner.</li>
