                <!-- Introduction -->
                <p id="top" class="p-summary"><em>This is a submission for the <a href="https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/self-expression-indieweb-carnival-march-2025" class="u-in-reply-to h-cite">March 2025 IndieWeb Carnival on Self-Expression</a> hosted by <a href="https://lifeofpablo.com/">Pablo Morales</a>.</em></p>
                <p>To exist is to explain. Especially if you occupy multiple intersecting identities. As a queer, neurodivergent, homeschooled, overseas raised, intermediate Spanish speaking, twenty-something who folks mistake as twelve... I have some experience.</p>
                <p>I could regale you with the ridiculous situations I've experienced (many I caused), the comments and questions...</p>
                <p>Why should I add to the world's negativity when enough for a thousand worlds exists in my head? Instead, I'll highlight the opportunities this gives me.</p>
                <p>As you may glean, I'm convincing myself as much as reassure you. So it goes.</p>
                <p>When I first traveled overseas, I was introduced to the concept of being 'an ambassador' for my nationality. As an Australian passport holder, I'm proud of the continent and its people, and critical of its failings. Isn't everything a duality? I visited many out-of-the-way places, interacting with folks who'd never met an Australian before.</p>
                <p>Folks dismiss first impressions as meaningless, but when your exposure to something is rare... They mean everything. So for people who meeting an Australian was an anomaly... Wasn't there an opportunity? To give these folks a good perspective?</p>
                <p>Every culture has a stereotype, unfounded, yet persistent, most people abhor. For me, it's 'shrimps on the barbie' tied with 'everything will kill you.' I've never seen <em>anyone</em> grill shrimps. Most folks call it a barbeque (derived from an Indigenous South American language anyway.) As for all creatures being out to get you... Leave them alone, they'll let you be!</p>
                <p>An example of how powerful first impressions are: a man bewildered on meeting an Australian who didn't swear every second word. Granted, I cuss <em>now</em>, but it didn't compute that some Australians didn't use expletives.</p>
                <p>Perception isn't the full reality, but it might as well be.</p>
                <p>In every interaction, on the continent and elsewhere, I aim to be empathetic and earnest. If I'm the only Australian a person will ever meet, I want to be a kind one.</p>
                <p>The same goes for every facet of my identity.</p>
                <p>As for my obscure hobbies, from having a website for fun, to zine-making, and fanfiction... These aren't for everyone, of course, but for the right person? Transformative! How can it become so for these folks if they don't know about it?</p>
                <p>Shakespeare's words are immortal for a reason. "There's nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."</p>
                <p>Next time something about my existence intrigues or confuses someone, may I see it as a sneaky way to plant a positive impression in someone's mind.</p>
