<h1>Notes From An Are.na Workshop: Channel As Gift (21 Dec 2024)</h1>
<p class="postmeta"><strong>Published</strong>: 26 Jan 2025 | <strong>Updated</strong>: 26 Jan 2025</p>
<p id="top">In late December 2024, I attended an Are.na Channel As Gift workshop hosted by Laurel Schwulst. Such a fascinating idea! These are my notes from attending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifting as a verb is more nourishing than the noun.</li>
<li>Gift giving is often separated as its own love language, but you could argue that all other love languages involve the giving of a gift.</li>
<li>Attention and time are the ingredients for a good gift. Being a good gift giver is about listening, appreciating, and considering. You make connections between disparate things and the people you love.</li>
<li>Living with the intention of generosity is gift giving at its core. Even something as simple as an email can be a gift: putting in effort shows you care.</li>
<li>A wonderful gift is a Venn diagram of what you and the recipient enjoy. A moment of connection often becomes more important than the material thing.</li>
<li>Thoughtful digital gifts: a memory capsule of photos, a playlist, a reader of recommended articles or books, summarizing your shared existence, an imaginary museum, reasons why they're loved, and a to-do list of fun activities</li>
<li>Gifting as an infinite game is a constant back-and-forth, a way of life.</li>
</ul>
