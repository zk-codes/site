            <p id="top">Saw many folks answering these questions, so I thought, why not answer them too! If you have a site, please do also if so inclined. (Kudos to Annie Mueller's <a href="https://anniemueller.com/posts/blog-question-challenge-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> for pushing me over the edge.)</p>
            <h2>Why Did You Start Blogging In The First Place?</h2>
            <p>I started writing on the internet to capture my notes from events and archive my existence, in the hopes of creating a time capsule for myself and something (hopefully) useful for others.</p>
            <h2>What Platform Are You Using To Manage Your Blog, And Why Do You Use It?</h2>
            <p>I'm not using any platform! When creating this site in March 2024, my aim was as simple as possible. So I use static HTML files, styled with CSS, and uploaded to my host's file manager.</p>
            <p>While I sometimes wish it were 'easier' to add written works and update, it's worth it for the simplicity, the fast-loading times, and the ease of editing/debugging.</p>
            <h2>Have You Blogged On Other Platforms Before?</h2>
            <p>Indeed! I've used WordPress for work since 2016, and currently my book blog, <a href="https://roadlessread.com">Road Less Read</a> uses it. I want to convert that site to static HTML, but haven't made the time for it yet. </p>
            <h2>How Do You Write Your Posts?</h2>
            <p>When I'm taking notes at events, usually I do it on paper, then transcribe directly into a HTML file. Lately, though, I've started writing in markdown in Obsidian, and using an online tool to convert that to HTML. Makes the drafting process far more pleasant!</p>
            <p>From there, I proof the HTML file, upload it to my host via FileZilla, record the addition in the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> and the <a href="/sitemap">sitemap</a>, and update the <a href="/assets/rss.xml">RSS file</a>. And yes, I do this all manually!</p>
            <h2>When Do You Feel Most Inspired To Write?</h2>
            <p>Good question! Inspiration only seems to come for fiction. Until now, and aside from journaling, it'd never occurred to me to write 'personal non-fiction or essays.' I'm still new to this! </p>
            <h2>Do You Normally Publish Immediately After Writing, Or Do You Let It Simmer?</h2>
            <p>I haven't written enough here to give a definite answer, but mostly I do two proofreads (once with software, the second time manually) before I publish.</p>
            <p>If you've discovered a typo or grammatical error in my work, please, <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>!</p>
            <h2>What's Your Favorite Post On Your Blog?</h2>
            <p>Granted, I've only published nine times as of the time of writing, but so far, it'd be answering <a href="/notes/proust">Proust's Questionnaire</a>. I was alerted to the idea browsing Xanthe Tynehorne's lovely site and finding <a href="https://satyrs.eu/proust">their answers</a>. If you have a site, why not answer it too? (Please <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a> if you do!)</p>
            <h2>Any Future Plans For The Blog?</h2>
            <p>Publishing more often! And with a wider breadth of subjects. Writing to learn, think through ideas, and find folks who enjoy what I find fascinating.</p>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Country</strong></p>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
