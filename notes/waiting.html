            <h1>Things To Do While Waiting</h1>
            <p class="postmeta"><strong>Published</strong>: 19 Apr 2025 | <strong>Updated</strong>: 19 Apr 2025</p>
            <p id="top">So your flight's delayed. Or an event you were going to attend has been canceled. You're stuck waiting for an appointment far longer than you anticipated.</p>
            <p>You've entered what I call <em>liminal time</em>. And this, dear reader, isn't a curse. It's an opportunity. As <a href="https://austinkleon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin Kleon</a> wrote in Steal Like An Artist:</p>
            <p><em>"Take time to be bored. One time I heard a coworker say, “When I get busy, I get stupid.” Ain’t that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing."</em></p>
            <p>Inspired by recent events, here's a list of things you can do while occupying this phase of existence. Some require a willing companion, others you can do by yourself.</p>

            <h2 id="single-player">Single Player</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Counting Objects</strong>: Choose an innocuous or overlooked, and see how many you can find.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stranger Backstories</strong>: Why is a person acting that way? Who are they talking to? What wild, generous, hopeful stories can you invent?</li>
                    <li><strong>What If</strong>: Choose something that&#39;s commonplace in our world, and flip it. For example, the sky is blue here, but what if it were green? Now, what would the consequences be?</li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow Car Syndrome</strong>: You may think something isn't common, until you actively start noticing it. You&#39;d be surprised how much your brain filters out.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>I-Spy (Riddle Edition)</strong>: The classic game with a brainteaser twist. Choose an object within sight, and create a puzzle for the other person to solve. Here are ones I created:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What has a nose and a tail, but no legs?</strong> An airplane.</li>
                            <li><strong>How do you ethically eavesdrop on a conversation?</strong> Listening to a radio/podcast.</li>
                            <li><strong>What sings, but can&#39;t speak, and breathes air, but can&#39;t whistle?</strong> A whale.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>One Sentence Stories</strong>: Start with an intriguing concept, and take turns, seeing what ridiculous and interesting paths it leads you down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two Words Per Turn</strong>: Inspired by a British Improv troupe, agree on an idea for a letter: the sender, receiver, and topic. Compose it together, two words per person per turn.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Want more? Though they aren't specifically games to play while waiting, The Art Of Noticing by Rob Walker is full of creative exercises for finding creative inspiration and delighting in the mundane. I&#39;d also recommend <a href="https://robwalker.substack.com/">the accompanying newsletter</a> of the same name.</p>
            <p>And if you have suggestions to add to this list, please <a href="mailto:hi@zacharykai.net">email me</a>! I&#39;ll add them and credit you.</p>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Country</strong></p>
            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
