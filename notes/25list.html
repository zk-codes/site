                    <p id="top" class="p-summary">Every year, Austin Kleon writes this post. A gigantic gratitude list for the past 365 days, if you will. In 2024, I also wrote one, though I only made it to 35 things. Still, a worthwhile exercise!</p>
                    <p>While it’s still the last days of December, I encourage you to write one too! If you do so, please contact me, and I’ll link to it on this post. Here’s mine for 2025, in no particular order</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <!-- The List -->
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visiting countries I didn’t think I’d ever go to: Turkey, Albania, North Macedonia, and Kosovo, where I’m living as I write this.</li>
                        <li>Meeting some wonderful folks while traveling. Chance encounters are often the best.</li>
                        <li>Being interviewed about my zines, live on radio! My first interview, and my first radio appearance. The hosts were a delight, and I’m so grateful for the fun (and nerve-wracking) experience.</li>
                        <li>Getting my zines selected for the Glasgow Zine Library’s collection!</li>
                        <li>Discovering new (to me, at least) artists I really enjoy: Chappell Roan, Omar Apollo, Sabrina Carpenter, Sombr, Wyatt Flores.</li>
                        <li>Reading a wonderful selection of fiction!</li>
                        <li>And equally great nonfiction!</li>
                        <li>Getting to see a literal ‘hidden oasis.’ Right in the middle of the urban forest, there was one of the plant and tree kind. Just extraordinary.</li>
                        <li>Watching the fireworks erupt all across the city on New Year’s Eve at midnight.</li>
                        <li>Discovering ‘UnOffice Hours’ as created by Matt Webb and further syndicated by Dave Smyth. I got to speak to some lovely people!</li>
                        <li>Seeing the enthusiastic response to the Internet Phone Book’s second printing!</li>
                        <li>Getting a piece published in the inaugural issue of Good Internet Magazine.</li>
                        <li>Submitting an essay for the second issue. Can’t wait to see it published!</li>
                        <li>Because of that first piece for the magazine, someone emailed to say hello, creating a friendship.</li>
                        <li>Doing a collaborative reflection on paintings with James.</li>
                        <li>Having a conversation with Sara about fanfiction, published on their website.</li>
                        <li>Finding the idea of ‘blog post title trades’ courtesy of Kami via Ava, and trading with folks.</li>
                        <li>Writing a few pieces on this site.</li>
                        <li>Writing a poem for competition, the first of many years. Despite it not making the cut, I really enjoyed playing with the art form again, at the encouragement of a family member.</li>
                        <li>Having folks chance upon my site and sign the guestbook. Always a joy.</li>
                        <li>Rediscovering old songs and artists I haven’t listened to in years as I re-compile my mixtapes.</li>
                        <li>Being able to admit to myself I love pop music! Even the mainstream stuff! What does it matter? Taste is subjective, as is joy. I’ll enjoy those tracks without overthinking.</li>
                        <li>Swapping mail with folks from the IndieWeb.</li>
                        <li>Making apple cake for the first time, and despite a few mishaps, it turned out well.</li>
                        <li>My first attempt at zucchini fritters since the previous year.</li>
                        <li>Having quinoa and farro for the first time, and really enjoying the taste.</li>
                        <li>Attending the monthly webweaving workshops hosted by James and Jay from 32-Bit Café.</li>
                        <li>Continuing my professional education by taking the following certifications from Hubspot: it was wonderful to learn new things and brush up on the basics!</li>
                        <li>Starting (but not yet finishing) a photo portfolio to showcase all my shots.</li>
                        <li>Commitmenting to finish what I’ve started instead of beginning a million things and then letting them fall by the wayside. I’ll be playing catch-up for a while, but it’s worth it!</li>
                        <li>Continuing to use, and slowly become more organized, with Obsidian.</li>
                        <li>Having waffles! The taste reminds me of ice-cream cones.</li>
                        <li>Taking on freelance projects for a software-as-a-service company, getting to learn how to use new programs, and deepening my existing skills.</li>
                        <li>Contributing to Wikipedia and Open Library.</li>
                        <li>At last, I converted Road Less Read, my book blog, from running on WordPress to static HTML and CSS files. It’s nowhere near finished, but you’ve got to start somewhere!</li>
                        <li>Watching these excellent films: Wallace &amp; Grommit: Vengeance Most Fowl, Wallace &amp; Grommit: A Matter Of Loaf &amp; Death, What’s Up Doc, The Electric State, Knives Out, and Glass Onion. I didn’t watch many this year, and most were early in the year, but they were great!</li>
                        <li>Watching Asterix &amp; Obelix: The Big Fight. It was a hilarious miniseries.</li>
                        <li>Participating in Weird Web October. I blame Joe, and it was such fun.</li>
                        <li>Attending Homebrew Website Club on almost every Wednesday evening it ran! Many thanks to James and Mark for being such generous, welcoming hosts.</li>
                        <li>Trying traditional North Macedonian food. It’s amazing!</li>
                        <li>Discovering how much I love avjar (a spread popular in the Balkans made with roasted red capsicum, chili, olive oil, and salt) and also roasted eggplant, unskinned and available in a jar.</li>
                        <li>Watching videos from my favorite folks online, including: NerdForge, Overly Sarcastic Productions, PricklyAlpaca, Kaz Rowe, and Rachel Maksy. And discovering some new ones: Honeybunch Of Onion Tops and Ashralouisa (thanks to Eri.)</li>
                        <li>Finding folks online who make videos about zine-making: Bri and Dayna Moth.</li>
                        <li>Listening to the Hard Fork podcast. Also, The Creative Penn, Ologies, Gastropod, Imaginary Worlds, Long Arm Stapler, and otherppl. Looking forward to discovering more!</li>
                        <li>Learning a few tricks to improve my cooking/baking, including: using a water bath to prevent burning a cake in a temperamental oven and getting a pudding-like texture and tossing veggies in olive oil and cutting them to even sizes to ensure consistent roasting.</li>
                        <li>Learning to make do with ingredientsavailable in a country and improvise when tools called for in recipes aren’t available. Using a peeler and knife in place of a grater or zester, or a solid-bottom metal cooking pot in place of a mixing bowl, for example.</li>
                        <li>Watching the third season of The Reluctant Traveler.</li>
                        <li>Meeting new folks and engaging in delightful email exchanges.</li>
                        <li>Having people notify me about my RSS feed breaking (thank you, everyone, and hopefully it won’t happen to you again!) I didn’t know so many folks take the time to read what I write.</li>
                        <li>Participating in several Kobo Writing Life promotions and having people take a chance on my space fantasy short story collection.</li>
                        <li>The never-failing delight of recommending songs to people and having them enjoy them.</li>
                        <li>A writer I deeply admire complementing my work (and reading it!)</li>
                        <li>Meeting a fascinating, educated, and well-traveled older couple by chance and eating out with them a few times. Having discussions I still think about today.</li>
                        <li>Chance encounters with strangers that turn into a however brief friendship: like getting a tour of a historic city center from a person starting a walking guide company for ‘practice!’</li>
                        <li>Rediscovering many artists I used to listen to in 2019-2022 but haven’t since. Nostalgia!</li>
                        <li>Starting a new job in publishing. Learning lots and building something I’m proud of.</li>
                        <li>Starting, but not finishing, the following zines: ten issues of <em>Overwrought Observations</em>, <em>Back To How To Belong In Myself</em>, <em>The Way I Always Feel At Home</em>, <em>No Need To Be Original</em>, three issues of <em>Esoteric Uses</em>, <em>Why I Don’t Talk About The Weather</em>, and ironically, <em>The Great Finishing</em>.</li>
                        <li>Reading weekly issues of Fix The News. Such hope! Such optimism!</li>
                        <li>Visiting some architectural marvels in Southern Europe.</li>
                        <li>Spending time in parks and walking the streets of new places. Always something new to see.</li>
                        <li>Visiting a bakery just to buy bread but then getting a guided tour on how they make their produce. That business had been in the same family for eighty years!</li>
                        <li>Eating a delicious bagel with bacon, egg, and avocado.</li>
                        <li>Speaking Spanish with native speakers for the first time in years.</li>
                        <li>Eating a custard tart, invented by the Chinese, inspired by the Portuguese, made by a Brazilian, living in Spain, while a couple from Brisbane waited in line to order theirs.</li>
                        <li>Trying authentic Italian gelato for the first time, ironically also in Spain.</li>
                        <li>Seeing a cherry blossom tree in full glory in a random alleyway.</li>
                        <li>Making cartoon faces with rocks on a beach of stones in the most extraordinary colors.</li>
                        <li>Taking photos of sunsets and sharing them with folks halfway across the world.</li>
                        <li>Seeing the Mediterranean from the other end of Europe.</li>
                        <li>Discovering a fondness for turmeric spice mix in milk.</li>
                        <li>Making the wise decision not to touch a beautiful plant hanging over the wall of someone’s garden. It’s Brugmansia, also called Angel’s trumpet. I quote Wikipedia: ‘Brugmansia species are among the most toxic of ornamental plants…’ Beautiful, but dangerous!</li>
                        <li>Trying pastries and egg dishes.</li>
                        <li>Perhaps being among the first people to attempt making a pizza with Bazlama, translated to ‘Village Bread.’ It was amazing.</li>
                        <li>Seeing amazing street art. Felt like a piece was on every corner.</li>
                        <li>Trying Nordic baked goods.</li>
                        <li>Tortoises everywhere. Under bushes, behind trees, in backyards…and they all looked to be the same species. Thanks to Wikipedia, I discovered the Hermann’s tortoise.</li>
                        <li>Thanks to Al Abut, paying attention to the stickers people leave in urban environments and found a world of delightful mini graffiti. A post is coming!</li>
                        <li>Realizing street poetry is also a thing. Please send your favorite examples.</li>
                        <li>After only knowing Hozier through ‘Take Me To Church’, taking the time to try a few others in his catalog, and discovered (surprise!) I adore his work! The back discography! Try it sometime.</li>
                        <li>Taking perhaps the only decent photo of a snake I’ve ever taken. This one was the Dice Snake.</li>
                        <li>Seeing cool public lighting with covers like the houses in the traditional style. I’ve said it a thousand times, and I’ll say it again: the small details are everything.</li>
                        <li>Ignorance, though so often derided, once broken, is glorious. Who knew North Macedonia existed in all its glory until this year? I didn’t. You can’t know everything!</li>
                        <li>Re-discovering Traveling Wilburys’ song ‘End Of The Line.’ I need to listen to more of theirs.</li>
                        <li>Seeing a bunch of cygnets grow up.</li>
                        <li>Reveling in my insignificance in front of trees of over five-hundred years.</li>
                        <li>The simple pleasures: like eating a sandwich wrapped in foil while watching the lake.</li>
                        <li>Being in mountainous areas. There’s something comforting about something so huge.</li>
                        <li>Having a ‘chip open sandwich’ to honor ‘Crisp Sandwich Day’, on Oct 25. I blame James.</li>
                        <li>Seeing the colors change as the season went from autumn to winter.</li>
                        <li>Reviewing books via Netgalley.</li>
                        <li>Being brave enough to ask some friends if they’d like to call for the first time.</li>
                        <li>Succeeded in making a banana cake in an oblong glass container.</li>
                        <li>Having an orange for the first time in ages!</li>
                        <li>Keeping track of things helps me notice patterns.</li>
                        <li>Getting an ARC copy of two books in one of my favorite series. Thanks, Sarah Wallace!</li>
                        <li>Starting the IndieWeb Book Club again, hosting the first month, and participating in the two subsequent ones. Looking forward to a year of fascinating reading!</li>
                        <li>Hosting an online event for 2025’s HTML Day. So much fun.</li>
                        <li>Hosting the first iteration of a spin-off of the above, Pixel &amp; Prose.</li>
                        <li>Starting my third and fourth websites: one for my independent press/freelance work, and another for messing around with experiments so I don’t break the other three.</li>
                        <li>And, the internet. My livelihood and lifeline. Long live the web.</li>
                    </ol>

                <section>
                    <p>Writing this took a while and much digging, but as always, it was such fun! Highly recommend doing it also. Thanks for everything, 2025. I’m looking forward to 2026.</p>
