            <section class="e-content">
                <p id="top" class="p-summary">You’ll find my attempt at a post with the aforementioned title, as suggested by <a href="https://blog.avas.space/" rel="noopener">Ava</a> via our blog post title trade! Read more about <a href="https://kami.bearblog.dev/lets-trade-blogposts/" rel="noopener">the initiative</a>, or <a href="/hello">contact me</a> if you’d also like to trade!</p>
                <p>We’re halfway through 2025 (already? time goes so slow yet so fast) and Ava suggested reflecting on my <a href="/notes/25goals">2025 new year’s resolutions</a> I made.</p>
                <p>I’ve made them every 31 Dec since 2018. Some I achieve, others I don’t. I have a complicated relationship with goals. The structure appeals, but the rigidity struggles to hold my interest.</p>
                <p>So, I’ll go through them, and see how I’ve gone!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Convert Road Less Read to static HTML.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’ve gone back and forth between if I should. I want to, for making the website last longer and load faster, using it more, and turning it into an <em>actually</em> useful site for folks...but I’ve made little progress. Probably because I’ve haven’t broken it down into manageable steps!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set up my Ko-Fi store with all my short stories, novels, and zines.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I set it up, and created the graphics, only to realize managing another web property and getting sucked into the social-media-esque styling...was hindering rather than helping. I’ve removed my account, and am using my site instead. I have plans to improve its usefulness!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Launch <a href="/newsletter">monthly newsletter</a>.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you count launching two editions three months late, then not publishing for another four, then, yes? I’d like a more consistent publishing schedule.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Produce and publish 1 new zine quarterly.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haven’t managed this one. I created two zines in December (<a href="/zines/dtaoya">Don’t Throw Any Of Yourself Away</a> and <a href="/zines/ptcl">Pushing The Character Limit</a>) but haven’t made any since!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Re-release The Mara Files.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No progress whatsoever, except setting up a few publishing platforms? The task is daunting...so I’ve done nothing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Research the traditional publishing process.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I attended a fascinating virtual talk by Seth Fishman, who to my delight, is Becky Chambers’ agent! He has excellent taste. His advice was solid, and I took countless notes, if that...signifies even a little progress?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Write and publish two articles monthly: one for this site and one for Road Less Read.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’ve published a few <a href="/sitemap#notes">notes</a> on this site (part of trading post titles is forcing myself to write more frequently) but nothing on Road Less Read.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Submit to two literary magazines/anthologies per month.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I submitted five things in February, but have only submitted two additional things since.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Submit this site to web directories.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A yes! I’ve joined several delightful webrings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finish the Don’t Burn Too Bright manuscript.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’ve organized it, assembled more scenes, and wrote a few missing one. It’s still only ~4000 words long, though.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Begin and complete the first draft of a new book (to look at traditional publishing.)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nothing! Unfortunately.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Attend one creative event monthly.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This one is in the bag! I attend <a href="https://events.indieweb.org" rel="noopener">Homebrew Website Club</a> (almost) every Wednesday, which is the highlight of my week, and I’ve attended several author talks. Always love those!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Make a journal entry every evening.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haven’t managed every day, but I often do it in the morning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to five new songs monthly.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’m unsure of the specifics but I’ve discovered several artists this year! Parcels, Wyatt Flores, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Aitana.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Read two good fiction books monthly.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easily done! I’ve read many great novels this year. A pleasant change from my almost exclusive focus on non-fiction last year.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Create a public progress tracker on this site, do a quarterly goal review and adjustment, record monthly progress updates via the newsletter.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As you can tell, I’ve done none.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>So far...it’s been a lot of <em>no</em> progress. I’m disappointed, but not surprised. There's work to do! Still, I’ve done many wonderful things I couldn’t have expected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Austin Kleon shared a post of mine, <a href="/notes/waiting">Things To Do While Waiting</a>!</li>
                    <li>Many lovely folks have signed my guestbook.</li>
                    <li>An essay of mine got featured in the <a href="https://internetphonebook.net/" rel="noopener">Internet Phone Book</a>.</li>
                    <li>I contributed to <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com" rel="noopener">Good Internet Magazine</a>’s inaugural issue!</li>
                    <li>One of my favorite writers complimented my writing.</li>
                    <li>I got interviewed about my zines.</li>
                    <li>Had the chance to be featured in a small way on two of my favorite podcasts.</li>
                    <li>Wrote a few recommendations for perhaps my favorite newsletter.</li>
                    <li>Hosted the <a href="/notes/iwmcapr25">IndieWeb Movie Club for April this year</a>.</li>
                    <li>Participated in the Indieweb Carnival twice.</li>
                    <li>Emailed more delightful folks than I ever thought possible.</li>
                    <li>Got a pitch accepted for something I can’t talk about (yet.)</li>
                    <li>Landed myself a contract-based freelance series of projects via an unsolicited email.</li>
                    <li>Learned more about programming and web development.</li>
                    <li>Built out and streamlined my website.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The good and the not-so in equal measure. I must hold onto the former.</p>
                <p>Maybe that’s the point of goals: not arriving at some predetermined destination, but paying attention to the journey. To notice who we’re becoming along the way.</p>
                <p>Onwards and forwards to meaningful achievement!</p>

            <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
